# Pandas-vs-Bears

This is an image classification task that was done on the Pandas Or Bears image classification dataset. For this task, I decided to use Convolutional Neural Networks. This is because CNNs are a good option for doing image classification tasks. The framework i was using was Keras. Here is a kaggle link to the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/panda-or-bear-image-classification).
